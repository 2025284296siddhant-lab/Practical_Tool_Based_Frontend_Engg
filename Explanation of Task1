This HTML file creates a simple webpage with a centered main heading and two paragraphs.
The <style> section in the <head> sets the heading to be centered and the paragraph text color to dark grey.
Inside the <body>, the <h1> displays the welcome message, and the two <p> tags show short descriptive text.
